### Quiz

Q1: If all players have a weakly dominant strategy in a game, then there exists a unique Nash equilibria

* The answer is false. 

* If all players have a *strictly* dominant strategy in a game, then there exists a unique Nash equilibria.
* However, if at least one player has only a dominant (or *weakly dominant)* strategy, then there may be multiple Nash equilibria.

Q2: Which of the following is correct?

* A pure strategy is also a mixed strategy ✔
  * A pure strategy is simply a mixed strategy where one of the underlying strategies has a probability of 1, and all others have a probability of 0.
*  Pure strategy equilibria always exist
* Mixed strategy equilibria only exist for two-player games
* A mixed strategy is also a pure strategy
